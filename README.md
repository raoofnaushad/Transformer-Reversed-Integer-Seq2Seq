# Seq2Seq Transformer: Integer Reversal

Welcome to the Seq2Seq Transformer for Integer Reversal! This minimalistic Python project is designed to provide an educational exploration into the core concepts of the Transformer architecture. The primary focus is on reversing integer sequences using a Seq2Seq Transformer, offering a hands-on experience without relying on external libraries.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Seq2Seq-Transformer-Integer-Reversal.git

   ```

2. **Open the notebook and Run it:**

## Acknowledgments

This project draws inspiration from the foundational work on Transformer architecture. It aims to simplify and elucidate the inner workings of Transformers for educational purposes.

Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt the code to your preferences. Happy coding!
